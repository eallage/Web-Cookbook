main objective is to build screens and client functionality around data structure, usecase, dashboard, etc..

the idea is that there are lowest order views and modules/zones/interfaces, and these build to be higher order of abstractions built on top of them either through simply combining them or by reusing pieces or by accomplishing the same work in a smaller visual footprint.

the anticipation is that with ever abstraction from base level there will be more screens rather than less. this is because it is a logical delineation or abstraction rather than a functional one. meaining there will be redundancy or parody.

more or less each view should also have as small a footprint as possible while being as rich as aesthetically pleasing.
